Lumache - quick recipe generation in Python!
===================================

Hi I am maintaining here a documentation for **Lumache** (/lu'make/)- a Python library for cooks and food lovers
that creates recipes mixing random ingredients.
It pulls data from the `Open Food Facts database <https://world.openfoodfacts.org/>`_
and offers a *simple* and *intuitive* API.Lumache has its documentation hosted on Read the Docs.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.
